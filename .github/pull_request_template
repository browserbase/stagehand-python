## ðŸ§ª Test Execution

By default, **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **smoke tests** run on all PRs.

For additional testing, add one or more of these labels to your PR:

- `test-browserbase` - Run Browserbase integration tests (requires API credentials)
- `test-performance` - Run performance and load tests  
- `test-llm` - Run LLM integration tests (requires API keys)
- `test-e2e` - Run end-to-end workflow tests
- `test-slow` - Run all slow-marked tests
- `test-all` - Run the complete test suite (use sparingly)

**Note**: Label-triggered tests only run when the labels are applied to the PR, not on individual commits.
